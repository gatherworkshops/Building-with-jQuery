## Initialise Lightbox

This plugin doesn't need JavaScript initialisation.

Instead, wrap each image in a link with a data-lightbox attribute.

    <a href="image.png" data-lightbox="gallery">
        <img src="image.png">
    </a>


Note:

The plugin searches the page for all images with that attribute and works its magic on them.
