## Workshop Plan

1. Use a plugin to create an image gallery
2. Write some code to import images from Flickr
3. Write some code to react to clicks



Note:

Today we are going to learn how to use a plugin in our website.

We will write some code to load image data from Flickr.

And we will have a look at event listeners.
