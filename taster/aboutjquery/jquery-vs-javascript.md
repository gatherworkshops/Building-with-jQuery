## jQuery vs JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language.

jQuery is a library of code which is written in JavaScript.


Note:

jQuery is a piece of code written in JavaScript.

When you use jQuery in your website, you include it as a single JavaScript file. This is similar to how you include a separate CSS file.

That file contains a whole bunch of functions which make it easier for you to manipulate elements on your page dynamically.
