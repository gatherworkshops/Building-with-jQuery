## Upload the template

Open up your Neocities dashboard.

Click "Upload".

Select index.html, stylesheet.css and script.js then click "Open".



Note:

Uploading the two template files will replace any existing files with the same name.

Because Neocities give us an index.html page to begin with, that page will be replaced.

There is no CSS file, so stylesheet.css should upload with needing to replace any other file.
