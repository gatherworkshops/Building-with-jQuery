## What is jQuery?

- It is a JavaScript library
- Adds interactivity to websites
- DOM manipulation


Note:

jQuery is a JavaScript Library. This means that it is a large piece of code written in JavaScript, which allows us to use JavaScript functionality more easily.

It is most often used to add interactivity to web pages, like small animations, fades, and anything else which might change visually after the page is first loaded.

jQuery is a DOM manipulation library, which means its purpose is to help us easily change the Document Object Model, which is a fancy description for "the elements on our page".
