### Workshop Mission:
# Fun with jQuery

Note:
In this workshop we are just going to be covering jQuery.

We're going to start by playing with two plugins - one for making slideshows, and one for making an interactive image gallery.

We'll then move on to writing some more complex code to connect to Flickr and display some themed images.
