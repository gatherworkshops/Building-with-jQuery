## JSON Data

Many APIs offered by web applications use JSON as a way of transferring data.

    https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=rabbit


Note:

If you have a Flickr account, try using the API to load photos from your own account.

You'll have to find your user ID first! Might be a fun challenge.
