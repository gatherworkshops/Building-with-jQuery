    Your bubbles don't even have to be bubbles.

    You can change the CSS so they look like anything,
    including photos and animated gifs.

  notes: |

    Generating a random number always follows the same format.

  content: |

    ## Random Numbers

    ```
    var randomNumber = Math.random() * howMany + startingNumber;

    ```

    [ picture here ]

    **var randomNumber** : The variable to store the random number
    **Math.random()** : Creates a random number between 0 and 1
    **howMany** : How many numbers to choose between.
    **startingNumber** : The lowest number to include.

    We can also generate random colours in a similar way to
    how we generate random numbers.

  class: centered-slide

  notes: |

    Instead of a plain colour background, we can also
    use more than one colour to make a gradient.

- title: poppingbubbles
  class: centered-slide

  notes: |

    We can also make it so that we pop bubbles by clicking them.

  content: |

    ## Popping Bubbles

    In your moveBubble function:

    ```
    bubble.click( popBubble );

    ```

    Outside of all the other functions, a new function:

    ```
    function popBubble() {

      var bubble = $(this);
      bubble.remove();

    }

    ```
