    # Random Art
    _Creating living art that changes randomly_




- title: demo
  class: centered-slide

  notes: |

    Here's an example of something you might create.

  content: |

    ## Random Art Demo

    [demo goes here]

    You can create something like this but with your own theme



- title: background
  class: centered-slide

  notes: |

    Normally you would design your background using your stylesheet.

    Today we will so the same thing but using jQuery, so you can see 
    how to change css values using jQuery.

    Use jQuery to get your whole `#artContainer` as a variable.

  content: |

    ## Background

    ```
    var artContainer = $('#artContainer');
    artContainer.css('background-image', 'url(gathergather.co.nz/grumpy-cat.png)');
    artContainer.css('background-size', 'cover');

    ```




- title: createimage
  class: centered-slide

  notes: |

    Create an image and put it on the screen.

  content: |

    ## Create An Image

    ```
    var image = $('<img>');
    image.attr('src', 'images/bunny.jpg');
    image.appendTo(artContainer);

    ```




- title: positionimage
  class: centered-slide

  notes: |

    You should now be able to see the image on your page.

    Next we will change its position to see how we can move
    things around.

  content: |

    ## Position The Image

    ```
    image.css('left', 200);
    image.css('top', 200);

    ```




- title: randomlypositionimage
  class: centered-slide

  notes: |

    Your image should now be moved 200px from the left 
    and 200px from the top.

    We can change our code so that the top and left positions
    are a random number.

  content: |

    ## Random Positioning

    ```
    image.css('left', Math.random() * 300);
    image.css('top', Math.random() * 300);

    ```




- title: positionwithincontainer
  class: centered-slide

  notes: |

    Now we need to make our random number be between 0 and
    the width of the container.

  content: |

    ## Random Number Within container

    ```
    image.css('left', Math.random() * artContainer.width() );
    image.css('top', Math.random() * artContainer.height() );

    ```




- title: randomsize
  class: centered-slide

  notes: |

    We can also randomise the size of our picture.

  content: |

    ## Random Sizing

    ```
    image.css('width', Math.random() * 50);

    ```




- title: swarming
  class: centered-slide

  notes: |

    Now, we can create a whole swarm by repeating the same
    piece of code over and over.

  content: |

    ## Create a Swarm

    ```
    for( var counter = 20; counter > 0; counter = counter - 1) {

      ... code you already wrote ...

    }

    ```


- title: loopinganimation
  class: centered-slide

  notes: |

    There are some CSS classes set up in the stylesheet you can Use
    to animate your images to do something over and over.

  content: |

    ## Animation Loops




- title: mouseover
  class: centered-slide

  notes: |

    Mouse over and do something.

    Grow.
    Shrink.
    Random.

    Rotate.

  content: |

    ## Mouse Over




- title: mouseclick
