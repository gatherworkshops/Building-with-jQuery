## Adding Pages

To make another page, simply copy your `index.html` page and name the file something else.

Once you have created new pages, you can link to them in your navigation.

    <nav class="mainNavigation">

        <a href="index.html">Home</a>
        <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a>
        <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>

    </nav>

Notice the `href="#"` has been changed to actual page links. You'll need to do this in every HTML file!

Note:

Creating new pages is as simple as copying an existing one and giving it a new file name.

File names in HTML should be all lower case, with no spaces or apostrophes or any other special characters. Small letters and numbers only!

Don't forget that once you make multiple files, any HTML changes will have to be copied to every file.

CSS uses the same set of rules for every page in your website, so you only need to write the CSS once, even though every page has its own HTML code.
