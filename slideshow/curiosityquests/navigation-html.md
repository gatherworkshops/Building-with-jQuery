## Navigation HTML

Add the nav as the _last_ element inside your header.

    <nav class="mainNavigation">

    </nav>

Make sure you've got it in your `header` not your `head` - it should be on the line _after_ your `<h1>Page Title</h1>` heading.




Note:
Hey, a new type of HTML element! 

The `nav` element is used for creating navigation. It has matching start and end tags, and between those tags you put a set of links that you want to include in your navigation.

We'll get to that on the next slide!

If you preview your navigation right now, it won't look like anything - it doesn't have any styles yet! 

We did set up the class _mainNavigation_ though, so we'll be able to style this nav from our CSS.
