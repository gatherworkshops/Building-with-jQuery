## Navigation Styles

Now that we've got our navigation on the screen, we can start to make it look pretty.

    .main-navigation {
        background: #FF0000;
    }


Note:

Our nav has the class `mainNavigation` so we can use this in our CSS to add some design to our nav.

Keep in mind that we are currently just styling the `nav` element, which is a container for all our navigation links.

We'll get to styling the links soon, and make them look a bit more like buttons.
