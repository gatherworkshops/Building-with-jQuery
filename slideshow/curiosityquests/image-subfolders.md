## Image Subfolders

If you have lots of images, you might even have subfolders _inside_ your images folder, like "branding" or "gallery".

    <img src="images/branding/logo.png">
    <img src="images/gallery/photo1.jpg">

If you have subfolders, all you have to do is make sure you also include that folder name in your HTML when you use the image.



Note:
You don't have to use subfolders for your images, but it can be nice to separate them out based on the type of image.

If you find that you have more than about ten images on your website, see if you can think of some sensible ways to tidy them into folders.

Keeping tidy code is an excellent habit to have!
