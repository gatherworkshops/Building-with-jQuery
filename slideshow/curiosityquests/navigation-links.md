## Navigation Links

You've already created the `nav` element, but now add in a few links so we can test our design and layout.

    <nav class="mainNavigation">

        <a href="index.html">Home</a>
        <a href="#">Gallery</a>
        <a href="#">Contact</a>

    </nav>

Note:

Each link is just an `a` element, like we tried out earlier.

Remember that links always need their `href` set to a web address where we want the link to go. Because we haven't created the _Gallery_ and _About_ pages yet, we can use `href="#"` as a placeholder.

The _Home_ link will go back to our index page, so we can fill that in already.

If you preview your page now, it won't look like much but the links should at least be showing up! We'll give them some style next.
