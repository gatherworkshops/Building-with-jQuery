## Images Folder

To use your own images in your website, the first step is to make a place to store them.

Create a folder called `images` in your website folder.

    - mysite
        - index.html
        - stylesheet.css
        - images
            - logo.png
            - photo.jpg


All your images should go in this folder!

Note:
Folders can be used to keep your website files tidy. 

Web developers often have separate folders for images, JavaScript, different areas of their website, sometime even a folder for their CSS files, if there is more than one.

Folders should be all lowercase letters and have no spaces or special characters.
