## Net Neutrality

This idea that Internet providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally is known as _Net Neutrality_.

There should be no discrimination based on the user, content, site, application, or anything at all.


Note:

Maintaining Net Neutrality is important for all of us, so that we can continue to have fair access to the web.

Unfortunately, there are political and financial gains which could be made by treating networks differently, so this is a huge concern.
