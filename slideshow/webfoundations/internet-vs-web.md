# The Internet <br>vs<br> The World Wide Web

<br>
What's the difference?


Note:
So, the next challenge is this: of the words you came up with, which ones relate to the Internet, and which ones relate to the World Wide Web?

We quite often use the phrases _The Web_ and _The Internet_ to mean the same thing, but you may be surprised to learn that they are in fact quite different.

Any idea what the difference might be?
