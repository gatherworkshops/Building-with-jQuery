## Open Web Values

The Open Web is about the ability to openly do three kinds things:

- **Publish** content and applications on the web in open standards
- **Code and implement** the web standards that that content/apps depend on
- **Access and use** content / code / web-apps / implementations

Note:

In addition to Net Neutrality, which promotes free access to the Internet, we also have a concept called _The Open Web_

The Open Web has three rules:

- Anybody should be allowed to publish, put things online. 

- Anybody should be allowed to create or code that content.

- Anybody should be allowed to access and use the published content.

The web is for everybody and these guidelines are to help keep it that way.
