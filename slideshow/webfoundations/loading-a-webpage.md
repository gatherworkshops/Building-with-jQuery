## Loading a Webpage

![Diagram of how a web page is served](/Building-the-Web/slideshow/images/diagram_http.png)

Note:

So how does our computer load a web page over the Internet?

First of all the client, your computer, sends a URL request like "youtube.com" to your ISP (eg. Orcon, Spark or Vodafone).

Your ISP sends a request to the Domain Name Server, which turns the URL into an IP Address.

Using the IP Address, your ISP can find the actual server where the web page files are stored, and send them back to your computer. 

All these separate parts are owned by different people.
