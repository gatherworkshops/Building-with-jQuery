## Links Challenge

Make each of these links go to the correct page when clicked:


	<a>Search with Google</a>

	<a>Connect on Facebook</a>

	<a>Watch on YouTube</a>

For example:

	<a href="http://nzherald.co.nz">Read the NZ Herald</a>

Have a go at the [links challenge](http://dabblet.com/gist/30f3c027e95359fbcd7a)<!-- .element: target="_blank" -->




Note:

Try out this Dabblet and see if you can get the links all working properly.

Fill in the `href` attribute correctly for each of the links. The first one has been done for you.

All you need to do is find the web addresses that the links should link to, and put that link between the `href` attribute's quote marks `" "`.
