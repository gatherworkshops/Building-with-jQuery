## Element Structure

Every HTML element has a piece of code to start the element, <br>
and a piece of code to end the element.

	<p> </p>

These pieces of code wrapped in `<` and `>` are known as "tags".

The actual content to display goes between these tags. 

	<p> I love bunnies. Bunnies are great. Yay Bunnies. </p>


Note:
Each piece of content we put on the page is called an "element" of the page.

To create an element, we put a piece of content between an opening tag and a closing tag.

There is a set of HTML elements for us to choose from. `h1` and `p` are just two of the elements we could choose to use.

The type of element we choose should describe the content between its tags.
