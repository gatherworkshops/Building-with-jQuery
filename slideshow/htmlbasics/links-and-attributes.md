## Links

**The link tag is the letter "a"**

	<a>Click here!</a>


**But we also need to tell the link where to go**


	<a href="http://google.com">Click here!</a>

We add the web address using the `href` attribute. 

Attributes allow us to add extra "hidden" information to tags.


Note:

Links help us connect our website to the rest of the World Wide Web.

The `a` element stands for "anchor" but you can think of it as meaning "action" if that's easier to remember. Clicking a link takes you to another web page.

The attribute `href` stands for "hyperlink reference" which is just a fancy way of saying "website address".

The `href` attribute is what we use to tell a link where it should link to.
