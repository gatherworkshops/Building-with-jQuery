## Playing With Text

	<h1>This is a heading</h1>

	<p>This is a paragraph of normal text</p>
	
	<p>This is another paragraph</p>

Try formatting some text in [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/gist/334a12b63194776e5242)<!-- .element: target="_blank" -->




Note:

Let's start with some really common HTML elements.

The first line is how we make large heading text, using the `h1` element. That's a "one" after the "h" by the way!

The next two lines are paragraphs, which use the `p` element.

See how the start and end of the element are written the same, except for the  extra "slash" at the end? That's a really common format in HTML.

Try using these HTML elements in the Dabblet challenge.
