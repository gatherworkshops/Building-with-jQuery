## Header Styles

Add some style to our `header` container.

	header {
		background-color: #222222;
		color: #FFFFFF;
		padding: 20px;
	}



Note:

Our sample styles show how you can add a background colour to your header, change the text colour, and get the stuff inside the header to be pushed away from the edges a bit.

You don't have to have a background colour on your header if you don't want to - you can just delete that line completely!
