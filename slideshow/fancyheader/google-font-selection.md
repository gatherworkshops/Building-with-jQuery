## Google Fonts

For a simple logo design, we can start by choosing a nice font from <a href="http://google.com/fonts" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> then clicking the "Quick Use" button.

Note:

Have a browse in the Google Fonts directory and pick a font you like.

There are some filtering option down the left hand side if you want some more control over your search. 

You can even change the "Grumpy Wizards" text to instead be the name of your web page. That might be helpful!

Once you've chosen a font, click its "Quick Use" button which is the little sideways arrow inside a square.
