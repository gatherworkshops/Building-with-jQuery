## Adding the font to your site

On the "Quick Use" page, look for step 3.

![Finding the Google Font embed code](images/google-font-include.png)

Copy that piece of HTML code and put it between your site's `<head>` tags.

It should go on the line before the link to your own stylesheet.



Note:

The piece of code we add to our site's `head` is just a link to some special CSS on Google's web server.

Google is providing us a CSS stylesheet that we can link to so that we don't have to write a whole lot of extra code ourselves to correctly embed the font in our site.
