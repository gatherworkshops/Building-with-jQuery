# A Fancy Header
### Use a custom font to make a cool logo


Note:
Every website needs a great logo and a pretty header.

A site's header usually contains a logo and its navigation. For your web page, you can choose to have just a logo, or you can add some navigation too. It's up to you! We'll look at both options.

Have a think about the theme of your site and what its header might look like.
