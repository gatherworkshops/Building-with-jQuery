## Page Header

We can use the `header` element as a container for our title and navigation.

Start by adding the header HTML with a title:

	<header>
		<h1>Logo Here</h1>
	</header>


Note:

The `<header>` element has no styles already associated with it.

It is pretty much just a see-through box which you can use to contain anything you want.

Using a `<header>` allows us to group together all the elements which are part of the header, for easy styling using CSS.
