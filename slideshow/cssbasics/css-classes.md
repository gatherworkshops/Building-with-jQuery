## Naming your HTML elements

First you need to add a class to the HTML element you want to work on:

    <header class="page-header">
        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    </header>

Note:

When we want to add some style to an element on our page, we have to do two steps.

First we give an element a name, then we use that name to add design to it from our separate CSS code.

In HTML, we give an element a name by assigning it a `class`. The bit between the quotation marks is the name (or class!) you want to call that element.

We give elements class names so we can reference that exact element without affecting any other elements on the page.
