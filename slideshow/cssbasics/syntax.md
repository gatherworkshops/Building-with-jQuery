## CSS Syntax

In CSS, every rule needs:

- A selector (like `.page-header`)
- An opening bracket `{` and a closing bracket `}` 
- Some CSS properties in between the brackets
<br>
<br>


    .page-header {
		background-color: blue;
        color: white;
        font-size: 50px;
        padding: 30px;
	}


Also, don't forget the `;` at the end of every line, it's very important!



Note:
In HTML we use angle brackets like `<` and `>`. In CSS we use curly brackets like `{` and `}`. This is an easy way to quickly figure out if a piece of code is HTML or CSS!

This is what a single CSS rule looks like.

A CSS rule consists of a class name, plus one or more design properties that we want to set.

For this rule, the selector is `.page-header` and the properties we are settings are `background-color`, `color`, `font-size` and `padding`.
