## More CSS Rules

CSS rules are just written one after another:

	.page-header {
		background-color: blue;
        color: white;
        font-size: 50px;
        padding: 30px;
	}

	.intro-section {
		background: orange;
        color: black;
        font-size: 14px;
        padding: 30px;
	}



Note:
This is what it looks like when you have more than one CSS rule set up.

When you add new rules, you put them one after another in your CSS file. 

Always make sure you have a closing bracket for the previous rule before starting a new one!
