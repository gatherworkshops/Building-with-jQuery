## Styling a CSS Class

Then you use CSS to change the design of that element:

    .page-header {
        background: blue;
        color: white;
    }


Note:

Second, we need to use that class in our CSS to add some design. This code says that our HTML element called `page-header` should have a blue background and white text.

The class name you gave your element in the HTML and the class name you use in your CSS need to match exactly.

One little trick - don't forget the dot in front of the class name in CSS! 

There is no dot before the class name in our HTML but we _do_ need that dot in our CSS code.
