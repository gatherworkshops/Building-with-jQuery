Note:

JavaScript is used to define any interactivity on a web page: dropdowns, popups, anything that changes after the page is first loaded.

It can be thought of as the interaction language.

JavaScript is often known as JS for short, and is actually quite different from Java, which is another programming laguage with a similar name. Tricky!
