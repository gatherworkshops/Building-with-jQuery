## What's in the Zip

There are three folders: css, img, js<br>
And two files: index.html, README.markdown

We need to upload just a few of the files:

- css/lightbox.css
- js/lightbox.js
- img/close.png
- img/next.png
- img/prev.png
- img/loading.png


Note:

We don't have folders yet in Neocities so this will be a bit messy but we'll get through!
