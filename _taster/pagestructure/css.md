  CSS is used to define the appearance of a web page: the colours, the sizes, the layout.

  It can be thought of as the design language.

  It tells our web browser how to display the HTML.

  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

  This is a picture of what Google looks like when you combine the HTML and CSS.
