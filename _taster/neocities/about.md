notes: |
  There are a bunch of reasons why we use Neocities.

  You get to choose your own tidy web address under the `neocities.org` domain, like `http://mycoolsite.neocities.org`.

  The design is really lovely, which makes it a pleasure to use.

  It is both free and open source. As many free accounts as you like, and Gather Workshops can submit updates to Neocities itself thanks to open source.
