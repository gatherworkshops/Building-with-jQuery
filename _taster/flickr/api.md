## Flickr Public API

Flickr provides a way to search their images from code.

This means we can get a list of information about a set of images automatically.

The API we will be using is the public feed found [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/).


Note:

API stands for Application Programming Interface.

It is a way to get data in and out of an application using code rather than using a website or application that someone else has created.

Take a look at the API page.
