## Initialise the plugin

The backstretch website says to use the following code:

    $.backstretch([
          "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/515046/www/outside.jpg",
          "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/515046/www/garfield-interior.jpg",
          "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/515046/www/cheers.jpg"],
          {duration: 3000, fade: 750}
    );

You can copy this code from the Backstretch website.

Make sure to put in your own image URLs!
